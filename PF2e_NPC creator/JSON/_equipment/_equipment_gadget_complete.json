When you Activate an aetheric irritant, you sound the chime and place it on the ground in a square within your reach. The aetheric irritant affects an area in a @Template[type:emanation|distance:15]. Creatures with the fey, spirit, or undead traits must attempt a @Check[will|dc:18] save when they enter the affected area and at the beginning of every turn they are in the affected area. Those who fail the save treat the area as difficult terrain until the beginning of their next turn. A creature that critically succeeds at the save is immune to all aetheric irritants for 24 hours. An aetheric irritant continues to hum until it shakes itself to pieces after 10 minutes of being activated or it is moved, whichever comes first.</p>"

When you activate the spider bomb, you place it on the ground and the clockwork spider crawls 5 feet in a straight line, continuing to advance 5 feet in the same straight line at the end of each of your turns for the next 4 rounds (traveling a total of 25 feet). If it takes any damage during this time, its bulbous abdomen detonates in a raging flame, dealing @Damage[5d6[fire]] damage to all creatures in a @Template[burst|distance:5] (@Check[reflex|dc:24|basic|name:Clockwork Spider Bomb Explosion|traits:fire|showDC:all]). You can also activate it a second time with a single-action command word activation, causing it to explode. The spider bomb has an AC of 10, 5 Hit Points, and +0 to all saving throws. After it detonates, the spider bomb is completely destroyed, regardless of the effects of its detonation. If it survives to the end of the 4-round duration without being detonated, the spider harmlessly loses its explosive charge and falls apart.</p>"

When you Activate gadget skates, clockwork gears reveal small wheels that propel you along the ground, moving you up to twice your Speed. During this movement, you must succeed at a @Check[acrobatics|dc:20] check to turn up to 90 degrees, and you can't turn more than once or more than 90 degrees. During the activation and after the activation is complete, you can't Stride, Step, or otherwise move on the ground until the end of your next turn. However, you can use this movement instead of a Stride to perform a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.High Jump] or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Long Jump] just after the activation ends, in the direction of your last movement using the gadget skates.</p>\n<p>You can Sustain the Activation of your gadget skates for up to 1 minute. Starting on the turn after you Activate the gadget skates, the first time you Sustain the Activation each turn, you gain the effects of the activation again: you move up to twice your Speed in the same direction as your last movement with the gadget skates, and the restrictions continue to apply until you choose to cease Sustaining the Activation or you reach the maximum duration. Once the effect ends, the skates fall away and you can move normally.</p>"

In general, it can hear sounds that are clearly audible in the location where you activated it, but not sounds that would require a Perception check with a DC of 10 or greater to hear. The GM determines exactly what the instant spy can hear and record, as well as whether or not the recording is clear in a situation where the original sound is quiet, distorted, or intentionally obscured.</p>\n<p>When the recording is complete, once within the next 24 hours, you or another creature can use an Interact action to play back the stored audio in its entirety, after which the gem crumbles to dust. If no one plays the recorded sounds back within 1 day, the gem crumbles into dust anyway. This prevents the information from falling into the wrong hands later. It's typical to use the Conceal an Object action to hide an instant spy in a location once you've activated it, since if you don't hide it, it's relatively easy to discover in a thorough search, despite the fact that it's small and relatively unobtrusive.</p>"

Once a krasovnatype has an image on it, you can't use the glass plate on another creature.

It can be loaded with up to 4 Bulk of items. Most creatures aren't small enough to fit on the cart, and even for Tiny creatures, it makes for a choppy ride; while riding the cart, a creature gains two actions at the start of each of its turns, instead of three. Once activated, the cart moves forward at a speed of 30 feet per round on your turn for up to 1 minute. If it strikes an obstruction, it attempts to continue its movement, pushing with an Athletics bonus of +5, once per round. The wind-up cart has AC 15, Hardness 2, 24 Hit Points, and a Break Threshold of 12. After its 1-minute duration completes, the cart collapses back into scrap.</p>"
