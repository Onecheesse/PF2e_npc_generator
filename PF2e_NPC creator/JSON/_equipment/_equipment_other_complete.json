If you have a tindertwig in your other hand, you can activate the tindertwig and use it to light a fuse with the same Interact action. A lit fuse takes 1 round per attached fuse to burn down. During the round that the fuse runs out, the device to which the fuse has been attached explodes or otherwise activates at the end of your turn. For a bomb, this deals splash damage, and for pyronite, it deals pyronite's normal damage. An alchemical fuse burns underwater or in up to moderate wind.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> Interact</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You extinguish the fuse.</p>"

Many varieties of these alchemical cocktails exist, each tailored for the unique chemistry of a specific type of animal. You can, for example, make wolf pheromones, but not pheromones that affect all animals. The pheromones don't work on creatures that are similar to the specific kind of animal, but aren't actually animals—for example, wolf pheromones don't work on werewolves. When you learn the formula for animal pheromones, you learn the formulas for all common animals. If no animals of a kind are common, you must learn the formula for it separately, and the formula has the same rarity as the least-rare creature of that kind.</p>\n<p>You Activate animal pheromones by rubbing them on yourself or a creature within reach. The pheromones last for 24 hours or until scrubbed clean with 1 minute of work (consisting of multiple Interact actions). During this time, the pheromones exude a subtle aroma in a @Template[emanation|distance:15]{15-foot radius} that calms and influences the designated animals. A designated animal that ends its turn within the affected area must attempt a @Check[will|dc:27] saving throw with the following effects. The animal is then temporarily immune to the pheromones for 24 hours. The effect lasts for the duration of the pheromones, even after the creature leaves the affected area.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The animal is unaffected. It doesn't necessarily become aware of the pheromones, although intelligent animals might become suspicious if they observe others of their kind being affected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The animal's attitude toward the affected creature improves by one step.

You can, for example, make ape repellent, bear repellent, or snake repellent, but not a repellent that affects all animals. The repellent doesn't work on creatures that are similar to the kind of animal, but not actually animals—for example, bear repellent wouldn't work on werebears. Animal repellent is ineffective against animals with an Intelligence modifier of –3 or higher, such as awakened animals. When you initially learn the formula for animal repellent, you learn the formulas for all common animals. If no animals of a kind are common, such as sea serpents, you must learn the formula for that kind separately, and it has the same rarity as the least-rare creature of that kind.</p>\n<p>You Activate animal repellent by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature within reach, or by spreading it on a surface in an area up to 10 feet square. The repellent lasts for 24 hours or until scrubbed clean with 1 minute of work (consisting of multiple Interact actions). The designated kind of animal can smell the repellent from three times as far away as normal.</p>\n<p>The designated kind of creature typically avoids the coated creature or area, which smells foul and feels unnerving to it. If in combat or otherwise distressed, the creature can approach within 20 feet of the affected creature or area only if it succeeds at a Will save with a DC determined by the type of animal repellent. Once it succeeds at this save, the animal is temporarily immune for 1 minute. If the animal attacks in a way that causes it to taste or ingest the repellent, it must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|dc:24] save or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1} (or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2} on a critical failure).</p>"

The colors shift abruptly and unpredictably within and the opening of the bottle is sealed tighter than any other potion or alchemical item, emphasizing its dangers. On a successful Strike, the creature takes @Damage[1[force]] damage. Then, roll on the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.rollable-tables.RollTable.Wellspring Surges] table. The result affects all creatures within the emanation indiscriminately. For the purpose of determining the effects of the surge, use a spell rank of 4 and a DC of 23. The person Striking with this vial is considered to be the caster for the purposes of determining effects on the Mana Surge table. The emanation is centered on the target's space, and both the caster and the target of the wellspring surge are the target of the condensed mana. On a failed Strike, the surge only has an effect if it would normally affect an area; if you roll an effect that depends on a caster or a target, nothing happens. If the effect normally doesn't have a DC, creatures affected by the surge or within the surge's area must attempt a @Check[reflex|dc:23] save instead. On a critical failure on any saving throw against condensed mana, the creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Stunned] by the wild energies of the surge. Sometimes a wellspring surge's effects make it difficult to determine exactly who is affected.

When burned, a stick of <em>devil's breath incense</em> emits a brimstone-like stink and burns for 10 minutes. Varisian tales claim the stink of this incense closely matches the odor of the breath of the Sandpoint Devil, although it doesn't come close to the full stink of its flaming exhalations. A creature within 10 feet of a stick of burning <em>devil's breath incense</em> must succeed at a @Check[fortitude|dc:23|options:area-effect,inflicts:sickened] save or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 1} (@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 2} on a critical failure), after which they're temporarily immune to the incense for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>While a stick of <em>devil's breath incense</em> is burning, an adjacent creature can lean over the stick to inhale forcefully as an Interact action. Doing so consumes the entire stick immediately and automatically makes the creature @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Sickened]{Sickened 3}, but when the creature exhales its next breath, the cloud of smoke they breathe out attempts to carry with it a single curse the creature is afflicted by. The incense has a counteract level of 4 and a [[/r 1d20+12 #Counteract]]{+12} modifier for the roll. If used to remove the effects of the Sandpoint Devil's Accursed Breath (or similar effects, such as the Cursed Flames that the goblin witch Minargul can create), the <em>devil's breath incense</em> automatically succeeds at removing the curse, regardless of the level of the curse itself.</p>"

This potent combination singes the nostrils and throat, removing effects that make you sluggish. When you consume the pudding, it attempts a counteract check with a [[/r {1d20+20}#Counteract Check]]{+20} counteract modifier to remove the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed] condition from a single source, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract rank and DC.

Also, you can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Enlarge], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Speak with Animals], @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Speak with Plants], and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Web] each once per day as primal innate spells. The web is a dense mycelial net rather than spider silk.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 2 (1 Month)</strong> You gain low-light vision and fluency in Arboreal. However, your body feels stiffer, your mind slower to move to intense emotions, and you are prone to take your time making decisions. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Clumsy]{Clumsy 1}, take a –1 status penalty to initiative rolls, and gain a weakness to fire damage equal to half your level, and you take the same amount of additional damage from axes. If you die at this stage or higher, your body sinks into the earth, forming rich soil. Over several days, a mature, full-sized tree of the seed's type grows where you fell. If plant growth is impossible, such as due to lack of sunlight, fungi grow there instead, extending mycelia through the earth until they reach a place the tree can grow. Then, the tree grows. An arboreal can tend this tree to cause it to regrow one elder seed after 3 years and 3 days.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 3 (1 Month)</strong> You become more treelike and ponderous in body and mind, and when you cast the enlarge innate spell from this boon, you can cast it at 4th rank. The clumsy value increases to 2 and the status penalty increases to –2. Whenever you roll initiative, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1} automatically, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2} if the d20 roll is 10 or lower, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 3} if the d20 shows a 1. Your weakness to fire and vulnerability to axes equals your level.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 4</strong> You die.</p><hr /><p><strong>Purging</strong> You must seek out an arboreal, druid, or nature-loving fey that is your level or higher whom you have never met, and pledge your allegiance to that being. Doing so places you under a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Geas] to accomplish at least one meaningful service, usually a quest, for your new liege. While under the geas, you can't advance to stage 4. Once you complete your service, you regurgitate the elder seed, and its effects on you end.</p>"

A whiff of the concoction is pleasantly stimulating.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 1 (1 Week)</strong> The first time you enter this stage from a particular dose of <em>heartblood</em>, you are affected as if by regenerate. Each round this effect functions, it attempts to counteract one disease or poison affecting you with a bonus equal to your class DC – 10. <em>Heartblood</em> also reduces physical signs of aging, altering your appearance to that of vigorous adulthood for your ancestry. (Non-adults who drink <em>heartblood</em> change only in apparent vigor, not age.)</p>\n<p>You have fast healing equal to half your level, as well as resistance to void damage and poison damage equal to half your level. Also, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws (or any other defense) against death effects, disease, paralysis, poison, and sleep. Treat the outcome of any saving throw you roll against death, paralyze, or sleep effects as one step better.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 2 (1 Month)</strong> You gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. Reduce your current and maximum Hit Points by 2 × your level; you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 1}. You develop a pallor and a dislike of bright light, especially sunlight. If suddenly exposed to bright light, you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Dazzled] until the end of your next turn. While in an area of sunlight, you remain dazzled until 1 round after the exposure ends. Normal food is unsatisfying, and you have urges to consume blood; when confronted with the opportunity to do so, you must succeed at a Will save to avoid it. Doing so once after each time you roll initiative is enough. Your normal coloration returns for a few hours after you drink blood.</p>\n<p>If you die at this stage or higher, your body becomes a bloody mist that sinks 6 feet into the ground. The third night thereafter, you rise from the earth as a vampire. This typically makes you unholy. You are under the control of the <em>heartblood</em>'s creator unless your level is higher than that creature's. The controlling vampire senses you and guides you to them via psychic link. Significant destruction of your body and circumstances that prevent the formation of undead stop this effect.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 3 (1 Month)</strong> You gain darkvision and now have fast healing equal to your level. A death effect can't automatically kill you or increase your dying value. Reduce your current and maximum Hit Points by 4 × your level, rounded up, instead of 2 × your level; you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Doomed]{Doomed 2}. Your hunger for blood increases, so if you fail to drink a cup or so each day, you are considered to have gone without food that day. You are also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 1} while in sunlight, becoming @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Slowed]{Slowed 2} after 1 minute. Your shadow is wispy, and your reflection in mirrors ghostly, which are apparent signs of vampirism to those who know such facts.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 4</strong> You die.</p><hr /><p><strong>Purging</strong> <em>Heartblood</em> loses its potency if the vampire who created it is destroyed. However, a dose of <em>heartblood</em> imposes a –2 status penalty to your saving throws against the powers of the vampire who created it.</p>"

That's because it's been infused with a specially treated iron dust, which Sanra Copperstone promises will strengthen the bones and make for healthier skin. Eating this delicious, if metallic, stew adds that same sheen to your own skin, while also hardening it.

A low, soft chirruping around the crystal invokes the idea of using fire to cleanse and protect. The crystal offers this power to anyone who touches it. A partaker must be willing to gain the boon's effects.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 1 (1 Week)</strong> The first time you enter this stage from a particular phoenix cinder, you are affected as if by @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Regenerate].</p>\n<p>For 3 days after taking in the cinder, you are immune to fire. While in this stage or higher, you have fast healing equal to half your level, as well as resistance to fire damage equal to half your level. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws (or any other defense) against fire. Treat the outcome of any saving throw you roll against fire effects as one step better. You can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ignition] as an innate spell, and you have access to the following activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (concentrate, fire)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You wreathe yourself in flame for 1 minute.

You can Dismiss the activation.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 2 (1 Month)</strong> You can use the activation once per hour. Always feverish and flushed, you feel as if temperatures lower than sweltering are cold. Reduce your current and maximum Hit Points by 2 × your level, and you have a weakness to cold damage equal to half your level. You have urges to burn and use fire when you can. When confronted with the opportunity to do so, you must succeed at a Will save to avoid it. Doing so once after each time you roll initiative is enough.</p>\n<p>If you die at this stage or higher, your body burns from the inside out over [[/r 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}, reducing you to fine ash. Anything flammable on you is destroyed. A phoenix emerges from your remains, but doesn't have the holy trait and is interested more in selfish pursuits and spreading fire than kindness. You also attempt a @Check[flat|dc:8]; on a failure, the phoenix gains the unholy trait, and also thirsts for vengeance against the little beings like the one who dared to use its power for a time.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 3 (1 Month)</strong> You now have fast healing equal to your level but reduce your current and maximum Hit Points by 4 × your level, rounded up, instead of 2 × your level. Also, you have a weakness to cold damage equal to your level and a weakness to holy equal to half your level. You can use the activation you previously gained once per minute, but you can no longer Dismiss it. Whenever you drop to 0 Hit Points, a flame strike erupts from a randomly chosen point on the edge of your space.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 4</strong> You die.</p><hr /><p><strong>Purging</strong> You must collect the remains of a phoenix of your level or higher who has been unable to self-resurrect, compressing the remains with powdered diamonds, opals, and rubies worth 75 gp × your level into an egg. You can then use @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Divine Immolation] as if you dropped to 0 Hit Points during this boon's stage 3. If you do so, the phoenix whose remains you collected is reborn as if it used its Self-Resurrection, and the phoenix cinder's effects end on you.</p>"

Upon drinking the potion, your appearance changes, taking on different sex characteristics in line with another gender expression. You have little control over the details of the change, but it lines up with your deepest heartfelt ideal. More importantly, unlike the <em>serum of sex shift</em>, a potion of passing fancy doesn't impart the \"family resemblance\" effect; thus, a drinker too shy or afraid of being recognized to publicly express another gender as themself can experience the change more anonymously.</p>\n<p>A <em>potion of passing fancy's</em> effects last for 1 hour before slowly fading over 10 minutes; drinking another before the effect fully ends resets its duration and undoes any fading. If you extend the effect this way a fourth consecutive time, your actual form stabilizes with your current characteristics while retaining a \"family resemblance\" to your original form, as per the effects of a single <em>serum of sex shift</em>.</p>"

Once the fuse is lit, you throw it (an Interact action with the ranged trait) up to 50 feet away—if you hurl it into an existing fire, you don't need to take the initial action to light its fuse and can Activate the pyronite with only one action.

(A lit fuse can be extinguished with an Interact action.) If multiple sticks of pyronite detonate at the end of your turn, you can increase the area, but not the damage, of this effect.

The scene is realistic, but all observers can clearly tell it's an illusion. Observers can't interact with the scene directly nor can they taste or touch elements of it to get a sensation you didn't personally experience, but they can attempt skill checks to discern more about the scene without altering its contents. For example, no one could see something you didn't, such as the true form of a creature polymorphed into a squirrel, but an observer might be able to use Perception and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Sense Motive] to discern the squirrel was acting unlike a squirrel should.

Each one is unique and fits easily in the palm of a Medium-sized creature's hand. When pressed to the temple or lips of a sentient creature, that creature can immediately attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about any subject using a corresponding skill (such as Society to Recall Knowledge about a humanoid); they gain a +1 status bonus on this check. This consumable is not immediately consumed on its first use, but can be used three times before it loses its power and becomes a mundane, if still beautiful, twig.</p>"

It thrums intermittently with a beckoning vibration, drawing attention from and pulling at nearby creatures with a tangible sense of gravity. A chill hangs in the air around it. At a touch, the wisp vanishes, giving the point of contact a gangrenous color. If the partaker succeeds at the initial save, the wisp reappears somewhere on the same planet.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 1 (8 Days)</strong> The first time you enter this stage from a given void fragment, you gain the effect of a potion of truespeech for 3 days. The wisp grants you telepathy with a range of 30 feet. Also, you are under the effects of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Hidden Mind], except that its status bonus is +1 and it counteracts with a modifier equal to your class DC – 9 or your spell DC – 9, whichever is higher. The wisp grants you resistance to mental damage equal to half your level. You also have access to the following activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> or <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (concentrate, teleportation)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. If you used 2 actions, you can teleport up to 60 feet.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 2 (24 Days)</strong> You gain imprecise thoughtsense to half your telepathy's range, which increases to 60 feet. However, you have a tough time filtering the mental noise. If any creatures can be detected by your thoughtsense, you take a –1 penalty to Perception checks. When you arrive in a space after using the activation to teleport, you create a @Template[emanation|distance:10] that works like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Strange Geometry] for 1 round. This emanation can affect you.</p>\n<p>If you die at this stage or higher, your body implodes. Your soul reincarnates as an aberration of a level close to yours, which extrudes from the location of your implosion. Common forms include jah-tohl, gosreg, quelaunt, rhu-chalik, shoggoth, and xoarian. This creature isn't you, but fleeting memories of your former existence remain with it. You can't be raised from the dead while this monster endures. Its mindset is as alien as one of these aberrations, barely resembling yours at all. The void fragment reappears somewhere on the same planet.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 3 (32 Days)</strong> Your telepathy range increases to 100 feet, and the wisp grants you resistance to mental damage equal to your level. The mental noise increases the penalty to Perception to –2. Whenever you roll initiative, you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.Confused] for up to [[/r 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p><hr /><p><strong>Stage 4</strong> You die.</p><hr /><p><strong>Purging</strong> You must find and slay a powerful aberration or a servant of such creatures the GM deems appropriate. The creature must be of your level or higher. Then, someone must cast a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Rest Eternal] ritual on you and the dead being; you must be anointed with the same oils the ritual normally requires. If the ritual results in a success, it casts the slain creature into the void along with the <em>void fragment</em> inside you, ending its effects on you.</p>"

You can do so while you're within 500 feet of the portrait, even if it's outside your line of sight or line of effect. You visually observe the area around the portrait from its perspective, using your own visual senses. While you're scrying through it, the portrait's eyes follow others more than usual.

The painting loses its magic when the scrying ends, if 4 hours pass after you Activate it without you looking through it, or if you Activate a different watchful portrait. The portrait then remains a normal, non-magical work of art, but due to its rather bland subject matter, it is worth no more than 5 gp.</p>"
