                "value": "<p>Sometimes, just disguising one's face just isn't convincing enough. Clockwork disguises were invented to supplement regular disguise kits, which are used all across Golarion. For example, if a spy wants to infiltrate a military camp, they must be wearing the same type of armor as the soldiers stationed there-or else have a very good explanation for their commander as to why they're out of proper uniform!</p>\n<p>The clockwork disguise is intended to help avoid such awkward, potentially fatal confrontations. The clockwork disguise looks like a harness connected to hundreds of small metal plates that cover the user's torso and arms. Each of these plates is equipped with several hinges, allowing them to be shaped into a wide variety of patterns. When these shaped plates are arranged and connected, they can be made to look like almost any basic suit of light or medium metal armor, though armor embellishments such as those worn by high-ranking officers are beyond this device. The arrangement process takes some time, but once it's completed, the user need only perform a few simple adjustments to a clockwork mechanism in the disguise to make the plate arrangement into a new preset configuration. Afterwards, when the user flips a switch on the harness's belt to one of three positions, the plates shift, overlap, and connect as necessary to transform the disguise into the desired preset configuration. The clockwork disguise can have up to three preset configurations at a time, and most users use a minimum of two: the one required for their current task, and a suitably inconspicuous configuration for when the first configuration is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Giving a clockwork disguise a new preset configuration requires 20 minutes of work. The clockwork disguise can have a maximum of three preset configurations at a time, and it can only mimic light and medium armor suits made of metal.</p>\n<p>The clockwork disguise is light armor and has the following stats, regardless of which type of armor it mimics:</p>\n<p><strong>AC Bonus</strong> +2; <strong>Dex Cap</strong> +3; <strong>Check Penalty</strong>-1; <strong>Strength</strong> 12; <strong>Group</strong> plate</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Deploy Disguise</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Transform the clockwork disguise into any one current preset configuration of the user's choice.</p>"

                "value": "<p>The clockwork diving suit is a marvel of technology that allows its user to breathe underwater for hours at a time without the aid of magic. Compared to a more traditional magically-assisted diving suit using a bottle of air, a clockwork diving suit is both less expensive and better protected, making clockwork diving suits a good choice for characters who prefer more protection. However, they also come with a built-in time limit, which magical diving suits circumvent. A clockwork diving suit is a bulky, fully sealed suit of armor lined with a complex series of filter-equipped bladders that store and circulate air for the user to breathe. A glass faceplate on the front of the helmet allows the user to see what's going on in front of them.</p>\n<p>The suit's rigidity and mechanisms severely restrict the user's range of movement and keeps them from moving faster than a slow walk on the sea floor. To compensate for this, a clockwork water jet mechanism is installed in the suit's back. The water jet includes both a vacuum system and separate air bladder; it's activated with a simple pull of a lever on the suit's belt. When the lever is pulled, the vacuum system sucks in seawater, and seconds later, the air bladder sprays the water out and propels the user short distances. This mechanism is also necessary for the suit to surface without walking to shore-it's too heavy to float on its own. Most wearers can only swim a few feet before sinking back to the water's floor.</p>\n<p>The diving suit contains enough air for three hours of operation, and the clockwork components can operate for up to 3 hours before the suit needs winding. If you run out of air, drowning and suffocation rules begin to apply as normal. This air supply can be refilled by spending one hour in an area with air, and you can rewind the clockwork in a process that takes 10 minutes to complete. The diving suit is a suit of medium armor, and it has the following stats:</p>\n<p><strong>AC Bonus</strong> +4; <strong>Dex Cap</strong> +1; <strong>Check Penalty</strong>-4; <strong>Speed Penalty</strong>-15 ft; <strong>Strength</strong> +4</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">2</span> (manipulate)</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The diving suit shoots out a water jet that causes you to Swim 25 feet in a straight line. The distance of this movement is unaffected by your swim Speed, if you have one, or the armor's Speed penalty. However, difficult terrain, such as the difficult terrain for moving up or down or moving against a current, still slows this movement.</p>"

Padded armor is easier to damage and destroy than other types of armor. Heavy armor comes with a padded armor undercoat included in its Price, though it loses the comfort trait when worn under heavy armor. You can wear just that padded armor undercoat to sleep in, if your heavy armor is destroyed, or when otherwise not wearing the full heavy armor. This allows you to keep magic armor invested and benefit from the power of any runes on the associated heavy armor, but no one else can wear your heavy armor without the padded undercoat.</p>"

The armor served him well, but eventually he fell in battle against the demonic hydra Slithermaw. As Kyloss slew the demonic beast, its fangs pierced his chest and mortally wounded the elf. The armor retains several ragged holes along the chest and abdomen where the hydra's teeth damaged it.</p>\n<p><em>Slithermaw's Bane</em> grants its wearer poison resistance 10, and the resilient rune increases the item bonus on saving throws versus poison by 1 (to +3).</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Calistria's Sting</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">r</span> (concentrate, divine)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature grapples you</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> Poison wells up from the armor's links to seep into the triggering creature's body, causing it to suffer wracking pains as if it were being stung by thousands of angry wasps. The triggering creature takes @Damage[7d6[persistent,poison]] damage (@Check[fortitude|dc:34|basic] save); this persistent damage cannot be ended as long as the triggering creature continues to grapple you.</p><hr /><p><strong>Activate—Terrain Adaptation</strong> 10 minutes (concentrate, divine)</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You alter the exterior of the armor to better adapt to the surrounding terrain: aquatic, arctic, desert, forest, mountain, plains, sky, swamp, or underground. You ignore non-magical difficult terrain within the chosen environment and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against environmental hazards, natural disasters, and extreme temperatures that originate from that terrain. You are also protected from severe and extreme heat or severe and extreme cold (your choice when you activate this ability). This effect lasts until your next daily preparation.</p>"
